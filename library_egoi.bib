abstract = {Studied self-perceived personality change across 3 phases of adult life (young adulthood, middle age, old age). Drawn from developmental theory, dimensions were identified that were predicted to show self-perceived change during these age periods. Scales were written for the specific dimensions of complexity, generativity, integrity, and interiority. These were administered to 270 Ss divided equally among the 3 ages (young adult mean age 20.6 yrs, middle-aged mean age 47.8 yrs, and old-age mean age 69.3 yrs) and between males and females. Self-perceived change was examined by varying instructional conditions to include concurrent, prospective, and retrospective self-assessments. Four control scales from the Personality Research Form (Abasement, Defendence, Impulsivity, Order) were also administered and were predicted to show no self-perceived change. The predicted pattern of self-perceived change was supported for the generativity scale and partially so for the integrity and interiority scales. In addition, 3 of the 4 scales evidenced no self-perceived change. Sex differences were absent throughout the findings. (26 ref)},

abstract = {Ego integrity, Erik Erikson's (E. H. Erikson, 1963) concept of psychological maturity in later life and the pinnacle of 8 stages, has been one of the least studied of all his stage constructs. This paper explores the meaning of ego integrity (as assessed by C. D. Ryff {\&} S. G. Heincke, 1983) in the lives of a sample of older women, by examining the predictors and concomitants of ego integrity (EI), using data from interviews conducted with the same women in 1951 and 1996 and a questionnaire administered in 1996. A 3-step regression model revealed that “identity” assessed in 1951 predicted generativity in 1996; the level of educational attainment and marital status were also significant predictors. In step 2, generativity alone predicted ego integrity, which in turn predicted depression. Ego integrity was associated with higher marital satisfaction in the mothers' lives, both in the past and in the present; it was implicated in better relationships with their adult children, in the mothers' willingness to both give and receive help, and in several dimensions of psychological well-being.
